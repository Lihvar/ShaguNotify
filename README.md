# ShaguNotify

A Vanilla Addon/Library to show achievement alike notifications for several events. The achievement textures where backported from later clients. As there isn't any animation API inside classic, it can't look 100% accurate, however, i did my best.

## Triggers:

- **Quest Completion:** A notification is shown for each completed quest
- **Level Up:** Triggers each Levelup. Every 10th level is shown as special notification
- **Combat Survive:** Survive having less than 3% Health during a fight
