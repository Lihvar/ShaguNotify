# ShaguNotify

A Vanilla Addon/Library to show achievement alike notifications for several events. The achievement textures where backported from later clients. As there isn't any animation API inside classic, it can't look 100% accurate, however, i did my best.

By default, this addon shows achievments for each finished quest objectives.
